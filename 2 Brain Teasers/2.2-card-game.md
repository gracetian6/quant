# Card Game

## Problem
A casino offers a card game using a normal deck of 52 cards. The rule is that you turn over two cards each time. 
For each pair, if both are black, they go to the dealer's pile; if both are red, they go to your pile; 
if one black and one red, they are discarded. The process is repeated until you two go through all 52 cards. 
If you have more cards in the pile, you win $100; otherwise (including ties) you get nothing. The casino
allows you to negotiate the price you want to pay for the game. **How much would you be willing to pay to play this game?**

## Solution
Mistake: going into detail about probabilities for RR, RB/BR, BB.

Each pair of discarded cards have one black card and one red card, so **equal number of red and black cards** are discarded.
So, the number of red cards left for me and number of black cards for the dealer are always the same. The dealer always wins! 

We should not pay anything.

**Tip:** Brain teaser's won't go into heavily math/calculations. Pay attention to symmetry and design of problem - discarded pairs are black and red card.
