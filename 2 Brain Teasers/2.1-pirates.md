# Screwy Pirates

Chapter 2.1 Problem Simplification, page 3

Five pirates looted a chest full of 100 gold coins ...
How will the gold coins be divided in the end?

## Solution

Start with a simplified version first and build up to complicated version!

- 1 pirate: Pirate 1 takes all 100 coins
- 2 pirates: Pirate 2 takes all 100 coins, Pirate 1 nothing (gets 50% votes)
- 3 pirates: **Who gets nothing if pirate 3 gets voted down?** => pirate 1 (step above)
  - so pirate 1 will accept 1 coin =>  2 votes! (pirate 3, pirate 1)
  - pirate 2 will always vote down unless it gets 100 coins (step above)
  - pirate 1 = 99, pirate 2 = 0, pirate 3 = 1
- 4 pirates: **Who gets nothing if pirate 4 gets voted down?** => pirate 2 (step above)
  - so pirate 2 will accept 1 coin => 2 votes (pirate 4, pirate 2)
  - pirate 4 = 99, pirate 3 = 0, pirate 2 = 1, pirate 1 = 0
- 5 pirates: **Who gets nothing if pirate 5 gets voted down?** => pirate 3, 1 (step above)
  - pirate 3 and 1 will accept 1 coin => 3 votes (pirate 5, 3, 1)
  - pirate 5 = 98, pirate 4 = 0, pirate 3 = 1, pirate 2 = 0, pirate 1 = 1
  
- 2n + 1 pirates: **Who gets nothing if pirate n gets voted down?** => pirate 1, 3, ... 2n-1
  - pirate 1, 3, ... 2n-1 will accept 1 coin => n votes
  - so, 1 coin to pirates 1, 3, ... 2n-1, rest to pirate 2n+1
  
  
| Total |    1    |  2    |   3    |  4     |    5   |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|  1    |  100   |        |        |        |        |
|  2    |  100   |   0    |        |        |        |
|  3    |  99    |   0    |    1   |        |        |
|  4    |  99    |   0    |    1   |     0  |        |
|  5    |  98    |   0    |    1   |     0  |    1   |

## Tips for next time
- start with simple example, build up!
- think about **who would get nothing if oldest pirate gets voted down?** 
This helps you isolate which pirates you should give 1 coin to. 
And who not to waste coins on (since they won't vote for you!)
- Usually for coin dividing / game theory problems -- pirates should not distributing equally. It should be extreme (low/high)
