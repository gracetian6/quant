# Tiger and Sheep

One hundred tigers and one sheep are put on a magical island that only has grass... So will the sheep be eaten?

## Solution
**Start from simple cases and work back up** (I forgot to do this)

When this happens, you should have to use the previous step to make a conclusion!

- 1 tiger: sheep will be eaten
- 2 tigers: 
  - First tiger who eats sheep will be eaten (becomes step above) 
  - so sheep won't be eaten. 
- 3 tigers: 
  - first tiger who eats sheep won't be eaten (becomes step above)
  - so sheep will be eaten
- 4 tigers:
  - first tiger who eats sheep will be eaten (becomes step above)
  - so sheep won't be eaten
  
  
- even # of tigers:
  - first tiger who eats sheep will be eaten (becomes odd step before)
  - so sheep won't be eaten
- odd # of tigers:
  - first tiger who eats sheep won't be eaten (becomes even step above)
  - so sheep will be eaten
