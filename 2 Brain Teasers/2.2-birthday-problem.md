# Birthday Problem
You and your colleagues know that your boss A's birthday is one of the following 10 dates:

A told you only the month of his birthday and told your colleague C only the day. 
After hearing that, you first said:
- "I don't know A's birthday; C doesn't know it either."

After hearing what you said, C replied:
- "I didn't know A's birthday, but now I know it."

You smiled and said: 
- "Now I know it, too."

The administrative assistance wrote down A's birthday without asking any questions. So what did the assistant write?

_Logical Reasoning pg 5-6_
## Solution
- Interpret the **logic behind each individual's comments** and try to derive information from these comments.
What does the first statement tell you about the next statement?
- Mistake: interpreting logic of entire paragraph instead of statements
- Mistake: not using the first statement to make a conclusion about next statement

|      | 1 | 2 | 4 | 5| 7 | 8|
|------|---|---|---|--|---|--|
|March |   |   | X | X|   | X|
|June  |   |   | X |  | X |  |
| Sep  | X |   |   | X|   |  |
| Dec  | X | X |   |  |   | X|

1. (You say) "I don't know A's birthday; **C doesn't know it either."**
=> day is not unique (can't be 2 or 7)
=> so month is not June or December

|      | 1 | 4 | 5| 8|
|------|---|---|--|--|
|March |   | X | X| X|
| Sep  | X |   | X|  |

2. (C say) "I didn't know A's birthday, but now I know it."
if Month is not in June or Dec
=> C would only know immediately if it's day 1, 4, 8

3. (You say) "Now I know it, too."
=> I would know immediately if it's day 1 (September 1st)
