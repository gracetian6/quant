# Birthday Problem
You and your colleagues know that your boss A's birthday is one of the following 10 dates:

A told you only the month of his birthday and told your colleague C only the day. 
After hearing that, you first said:
- "I don't know A's birthday; C doesn't know it either."

After hearing what you said, C replied:
- "I didn't know A's birthday, but now I know it."

You smiled and said: 
- "Now I know it, too."

The administrative assistance wrote down A's birthday without asking any questions. So what did the assistant write?

- Mistake: interpreting logic of entire paragraph instead of statements
- Mistake: not using the first statement to make a conclusion about next statement
