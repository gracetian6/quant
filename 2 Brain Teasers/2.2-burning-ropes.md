# Burning Ropes
You have two ropes, each of which takes 1 hour to burn. But either rope has different densities at different points, 
so there's no guarantee of consistency in the time it takes different sections within the rope ot burn. How do you use 
these two ropes to measure 45 minutes?

## Solution
If you light both ends of a 1 hour rope simultaneously, it takes 30 minutes to burn.

1. light both ends of first rope AND light one end of the second rope
2. after first rope burned (30 minutes), light both ends of 2nd rope (30 minute rope)
3. second rope will be burned out in + 15 minutes

**Mistake**: Not thinking about lighting both ends of the rope, and only thinking about lighting one end of the rope.
**Tip** you're not limited to burning one end of the rope!
