# River Crossing
Four people need to cross a river... what is the minimum time to get all of them across to the other side?

Section 2.2 Logic Reasoning, page 5

## Solution
**Mistake:** Not grouping 10 and 5 together.
Sending 10 with 1 and 5 with 1/2 so that we can send back 1 / 2 on the way back. 

Instead: 10 and 5 should go together first (10 in one round). Otherwise if we send 10 and 5 separately it'll be expensive (+10 +5)
In order to do this, 10 and 5 should not be sent in the first crossing, otherwise one of them will have to go back.

- [10, 5] send 2 and 1 (+2) 
- [10, 5, 1] send 1 back (+1)
- [1] send 10 and 5 (+10) 
- [1 2] send 2 back (+2)
- [] send 1 and 2 (+2)

This gives us a total of 17. 

Important things to keep in mind: 
- sending 2 and 1 in the beginning is important so that we can send one of 2 and 1 back in the future.
- **Mistake** only sending 1 back and forth is inefficient
  - send 1 and 2 so you can send either of them back in the future rounds.
