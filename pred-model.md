## Classification Predictive Modeling
Approximates a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to **discrete output variables (y)** which are often categories. 
So, the mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation. Often predicts the probability of given
example belonging to output class. 

Categories: binary classification problem (2 classes), multi-class classification problem (3+ classes), 
multi-label classification problem (an ex assigned multiply classes)

Example: predicting probability that email is spam or not spam
Statistic: Classification Accuracy (% of correctly classified examples out of all predictions) 

## Regression Predictive Modeling
Approximates a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to **continuous output variables (y)**

Example: predicting how much a house is predicted to sell ($100k - $200k)
Statistic: RMSE
