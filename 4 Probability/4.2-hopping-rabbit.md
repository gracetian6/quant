# Hopping Rabbit
A rabbit sits at hte bottom of a staircase with n stairs. The rabbit can hop up only one or two stairs at a time. How many different ways are there for 
the rabbit to ascend to the top of the stairs?

## Solution
Simple cases first.
- n = 1: f(1) = 1
- n = 2: f(2) = 2

for n > 2, we consider two cases: whether last hop is 1 or 2. 
- If the last hop is 1, then we have f(n-1)
- If the last hop is 2, then we have f(n-2)
- Total: f(n-1) + f(n-2)
