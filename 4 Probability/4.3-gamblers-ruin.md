# Gambler's Ruin
Gambler's Ruin: What is the probability that he will end up with N dollars?

Expected Value: If Heads come up with prob 70% and we flip a tail, what is the expected number of flips it takes to get the same number of heads as tails?

## Soln
DO: Write out recurrent equations. Also write out random walk number line! 

DONT: calculate small cases, since that takes a lot of calculations.

The recurrence equations will be in terms of each other, and also have higher order terms. It's important to reduce these **into differences**. 
Then you can take the differences, keep plugging in higher and higher differences. You'll find a **geometric series** that you can then find the sum of.

For example, in Gambler's Ruin we have

P_i = pP_{i+1} + qP_{i-1} => P_{i+1} - P_i = q/p(P_i - P_{i-1}) = .... = (q/p)^i (P_1 - P_0)

We know what P_0 is which further simplifies it.
