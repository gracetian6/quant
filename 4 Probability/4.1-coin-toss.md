# Coin toss Game
Gambler A (n+1 coins), Gambler B (n coins)

What is the probability that A will have more heads than B if both flip all their coins?

## Solution
Let's say A and B both have n coins to use _symmetry_.

E_1: A > B => w.p. x

E_2: A = B => w.p y

E_3: A < B => w.p. x

So, we have **2x+y=1**.

When we add n+1 coins:
- E_1 still happens w.p. x
- E_3 still happens w.p. x. A won't have more than B.
- E_2 differs. A > B if A is heads on (n+1)th. So happens w.p. 0.5y

So, P(A > B) = x + 0.5y = x + 0.5(1-2x) = **0.5**
