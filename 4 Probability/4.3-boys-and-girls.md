## Part A
A company i sholding a dinner for working mothers with at least one son. Ms. Jackson, a mother with two children, is invited.
What is the probability that both children are boys?

***Given that there is at least one boy in two children, what is the conditional probability that both children are boys?**

### Solution A
Apply Bayes - partition events to be 1) event that at least one of the children is a boy and 2) event that both children are boys.

## Part B
Your new colleague, Ms. Parker is known to have two children. If you see her walking with one of her childrena dn taht child is a boy, 
what is the probability that both children are boys?

***Given one child is a boy, what is the conditional probability that the other child is also a boy?**

### Solution B
P(both boys| one is a boy) = P(second is a boy | one is boy) = P(second is a boy) 1/2.
