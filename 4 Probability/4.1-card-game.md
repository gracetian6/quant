# Card Game
If you have a larger number, you win; if the numbers are equal or yours is smaller, 
the house wins - as in all other casinos the house always has better odds of winning.
What is your probability of winning?

## Solution
Use **SYMMETRY** like in https://github.com/gracetian6/quant/blob/master/4%20Probability/4.1-coin-toss.md

Consider 3 events: 
- E_1: I have a bigger number
- E_2: I have the same number
- E_3: I have a smaller number

E_2 happens with probability 3/51. So E_1 happens w.p. 1/2 ( 1 - 3/51) = 8/17.
