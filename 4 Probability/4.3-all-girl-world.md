# All-girl world?
In a primtiive society, every couple prefers to have a baby girl. There is a 50% chance that each child they have is a girl, and the genders of their children
are mutually independent. If each couple insists on having more children until they get a girl and they have a girl they will stop having more children, 
what will eventually hapen to the fraction of girls in this society.

## Solution
Note
- genders are mutually **independent**
- **50%** chance of girls

Every new born child has equal probability of being a boy or a girl reardless of the gender of any other children. 
So the fraction of girls born is always 50% and the fraction of girls in the society will stay stable at 50%
