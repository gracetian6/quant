## What is R^2?
- 1 - (sum of squared residuals for predicted Y) / (sum of squared residuals for mean of Y)
- = 1 - Var(fit) / Var(mean)
- proportion of variance explained by the line / predictor 
  - OR 60% reduction of variance when we take [predictor] into account

Note: variance is average sum of squares

## How to estimate R^2
For the denominator, Take the range of y. 

For the numerator, Take the residual of worst data/estimate above the line and worst estimate below the line, find that total. 

Then divide this by the 

## It's possible for R^2 to be negative if model is bad. 

## Alternatives
- adjusted R^2 which penalizes for added variables
