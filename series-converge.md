## When does the series converge?
When does infinite series 1/n converge? How about inifinite series 1/n^2? 

### Solution
Use integral test. 
- If \int_1^{\infty} f(x) dx converges, then \sum_{x=1}^\infty f(x) converges
- If \int_1^{\infty} f(x) dx diverges, then \sum_{x=1}^\infty f(x) diverges

integral of 1/n is ln(n). So the integral plugged in would be ln(\infty) - ln(1) which diverges.
integral of 1/n^2 is n^-1. So the integral plugged in would be 1/infty - 1/1 which converges.
