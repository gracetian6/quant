# Machine Learning
## Supervised Learning
- uses labeled data: predictor variables/features and a target variable
- Has a target outcome variable to predict. Input data used is well known and is labeled. More complex. 
- Ex: regression, decision tree, random forest, knn, logistic regression.

## Unsupervised Learning
- uses unlabeled data
- uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
- Do not have a target outcome variable to predict. Input data used is not known nor labeled. Less complex. 
- Ex: Apriori algorithm, k-means, clustering

## Reinforcement Learning
- software agents interact with an environment
- machine is trained to make specific decisions, trains itself continually using trial and error 
  - agent, environment, and actions
- ex: google maps routes, markov decision process, alpha-go
