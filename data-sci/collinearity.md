## Collinearity

Collinearity occurs when predictors in regression are so highly correlated that you can't distinguish their indivudal effects 
on the response variable. An extreme case of confounding (i.e. 2 variables contain the same info as 2 other variables / redundant variables). 

(dealt with issues of confounding when doing the weather data analysis for Boston Bike share) 

Confounding: important predictor (when omitted) leads to spurious relationships in regressione quation

### Effects 
- Regression coefficients change dramatically when other variables included or excluded
- beta coefficients not accurately estimated, standard errors are large
- Predictors with strong known relationship won't be accurately estimated
