# Neural Networks
AI > ML > Deep Learning
- Classical models use one algorithm for feature extraction followed by a machine learning classifier
- neural networks do the optimization altogether.
- first few layers transform the input into features which are easy to be classified
- final layer separates the data based on the features which the previous layers have generated


## Back Propagation
- starts with last parameter, and works its way backwards to estimate all other parameters
